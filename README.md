# Vite + React.js Project

Welcome to my **Vite + React.js** project! 🎉

This repository is part of my personal learning journey where I aim to strengthen my logic and frontend development skills by building small but meaningful components like dropdowns, accordions, stopwatches, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dropdown Component**: Custom dropdown with smooth animations and accessibility.
- **Accordion**: Expandable and collapsible sections for FAQs or content display.
- **Stopwatch**: Functional stopwatch with start, pause, and reset functionality.
- **Other Components**: Various reusable components to practice and explore React.js concepts.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Vite**: Fast development server and optimized build tool.
- **React.js**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language for logic implementation.
- **CSS/Tailwind CSS**: Styling components and ensuring responsive designs.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Strengthen my problem-solving and logic-building skills.
2. Learn and implement best practices for React component development.
3. Experiment with modern frontend tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS.
4. Create reusable and maintainable components for various applications.

## 📚 What I've Learned

Setting up a project with Vite for fast development.
Creating dynamic components with React.js.
Managing component state with React Hooks like useState and useEffect.
Styling components using CSS/Tailwind CSS.
Debugging and improving performance of React applications.


## 📜 Future Plans

Add more components like modals, carousels, and form validation.
Integrate state management libraries like Redux or Context API.
Build a small project using all these components (e.g., a dashboard or interactive app).
Deploy the project to Vercel or Netlify.
